- **Secrets Management**: GitHub Secrets for sensitive configuration
- **Automated Releases**: Semantic versioning and automated changelog generation

### 🔍 **Observability Stack (Free/Local)**
- **Metrics**: Prometheus with custom business metrics
- **Visualization**: Grafana dashboards for SLI/SLO monitoring
- **Tracing**: Jaeger for distributed tracing
- **Logging**: Structured JSON logging with ELK stack (local)

### 🚀 **Cloud-Native Architecture (Local + Documentation)**
- **Kubernetes**: Local deployment with kind/minikube
- **Helm**: Charts for configuration management
- **Service Mesh**: Istio configuration examples (documentation)
- **Ingress**: NGINX ingress controller setup

### 🏗️ **Infrastructure as Code (Examples)**
- **Terraform**: Well-documented modules for major cloud providers
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Production-ready YAML configurations
- **Helm Values**: Environment-specific configurations

## Portfolio Impact

### **What This Will Demonstrate:**

**Platform Engineering Skills:**
- **Developer Experience**: Self-service deployment with Helm charts and automated CI/CD
- **Infrastructure Abstraction**: Kubernetes manifests that work across environments
- **Tooling & Automation**: Comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows and Makefile automation
- **Standards & Governance**: Security scanning, code quality gates, and compliance checks

**SRE Skills:**
- **Observability**: Full monitoring stack with metrics, logs, and traces
- **Reliability**: SLI/SLO definitions, alerting, and incident response procedures
- **Performance**: Load testing, benchmarking, and capacity planning
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning, secrets management, and security policies

## Key Differentiators

1. **Production-Ready Practices**: Not just a demo app, but enterprise-grade operational practices
2. **Cost-Conscious Architecture**: Shows understanding of business constraints while maintaining quality
3. **Comprehensive Observability**: Demonstrates deep understanding of system reliability
4. **Security-First Approach**: Built-in security scanning and compliance checks
5. **Documentation Excellence**: Operational runbooks and disaster recovery procedures
